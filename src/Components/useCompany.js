Mitch realized how much single use plastic is still used in the grocery shopping process, and started there.

When he realized his friends were also going through the same pains and struggles because of the work they did, Bill knew he wanted to find a do-it-all solution for dehydrated skin.

Frustrated, he took matters into his own hands (literally).\r\n\r\nOne morning, Bill whipped up a batch of beeswax and olive oil in a pot on his kitchen stove, desperate to find something that would work. After some formula experimentation and trial, Bill’s hands were healed and a new business was born! But Badger didn’t grow overnight. It took years of hard work, dedication, and desire to produce the best products possible. Bill tested his salves, balms, and creams on the toughest skin out there–the hands of his carpenter friends. After years of testing and trying, plus a new packaging and logo, he took his products door to door to local hardware stores, lumber yards, and health food stores. Each store-bought at least a $100 box of Badger Balm!\r\n\r\nNow, more than 20 years later, Badger is the same family-owned, family-run, and family-friendly company that puts the environment and its employees above all else.

Intrigued by the possibilities, Callee began researching homemade soap-making in September of 2016, with her first successful batch just several months (and several failed batches!) later.

    des: "Friends, surfers, and environmental activists David, Kevin, and Ben founded Bureo after traveling around the world and finding polluted oceans everywhere they went. As passionate ocean-lovers, they decided that they wanted to take action to make a difference and change the way people think about waste. Chile’s vast coastline and booming fishing community made it the perfect place for Bureo to begin its journey. \r\nThe team began working closely with local Chilean fishermen to find ways to collect discarded fishnets and transform them into something fun and positive. Enter skateboards. Fun, in-line with their surfer lifestyles, and an efficient, sustainable form of transportation, they were the perfect solution. Today, Bureo’s Chilean recycling program is called Net Positiva, and it is responsible for collecting discarded fish nets that are then melted down and re-created into Bureo’s signature skateboards and sunglasses.\r\n",

    des: "When friends and surf buddies, Alex and Andrew, took a trip to Bali–they were immediately introduced to the harsh reality of ocean plastics. Traveling through the island country, the two happened upon a fishing village, and learned just how much plastic pollution was affecting both the marine ecosystems, and the people who depend on it. \r\n\r\nAfter watching village fishermen struggle to push their boats ashore through mounds of plastic waste, they thought–could they use their nets to catch plastic instead of fish? The two realized they needed a better solution, one that could clean up pollution without keeping locals from their livelihoods. \r\n\r\nAnd so, 4Ocean was born. With each bracelet sale, 4Ocean is able to fund the removal of 1 pound of trash from the oceans and coastlines.\r\n<Br>",

    des: "What would make two Portland natives, both with successful corporate careers, drop everything and start something new? Perhaps a revolutionary idea for a company, one that would take a material little known to the western world and change the sustainable home game forever? Yes, exactly that. And then some.\r\n\r\nPicture this: It’s pre 2000’s and Jeff Dalkin and Rachel Speth, the co-founders of bambu, were living in Asia and working corporate jobs. Surrounded by such new settings, they discovered an eco-friendly, sustainable and versatile material they loved: bamboo. Immediately, the two began thinking bamboo was the next sustainable business breakthrough, but they had some questions: Can we create a profitable business that gives people not only affordable but quality products? And, can we do this using renewable materials while also reducing our reliance on plastic? With this in mind, the duo set out to learn everything there was to know about the wonders of bamboo.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Jeff kept his job at Ogilvy while Rachel resigned from her job at Nike. In 2003, after years of prepping, researching, and refining, bambu was finally ready for the real world! After two years of business, Jeff and Rachel moved from Thailand to Shanghai, China to source their bamboo locally, as well as employing their factories with local workers. Jeff soon thereafter left Ogilvy and the two put everything they had into bambu.\r\n\r\nAt bambu, they like to say “Everything matters”–and they mean it. From business decisions to customer care to their local employees, bambu strives to do the best they can every step of the way. Today, bambu is and continues to be a pioneer for bamboo manufacturing and sustainable home goods.\r\n",

With high-quality craftsmanship and a silky material that feels luxurious against the body, essentials by Boody are made to be worn and made to last. Using organic bamboo yarn as the material, this clothing is so soft that you won’t want to wear anything else - and so versatile that you won't have to! Boody makes everyday essentials because they believe like we do, that there is beauty in simplicity.\r\n\r\nA family-owned and run business that now offers its products across 15 countries, Boody got its humble start in beautiful Australia. Two best friends, David Greeblo and Neil Midalia, found inspiration in their combined experiences within the apparel and pharmaceutical industries. Their knowledge of health and wellness coupled with their passion for protecting the planet brought forth a clothing company focused on comfort and sustainability. These friends created their company based on their personal values and, although the brand has blossomed into an international seller, those values are still deeply set into the core of the business. The founders put transparency at the heart of the Boody business model because they believe that consumers have a right to know the full story behind their purchases. In their own words, the Boody objective is about “maximizing positive outputs and minimizing negative ones throughout the entire supply chain”.\r\n",

    des: "When it comes to sustainable living, oftentimes one of the most difficult areas to overcome is footwear. The mass market of sneakers, shoes, and boots consists of options made from synthetic materials in styles intended to be discarded and replaced over and over again. However, with the introduction of Baxter Wood, an innovative and green fashion start-up, our eco-options for boots have expanded! \r\n\r\nCentered around the idea of creative uncreation, Baxter Wood is challenging consumers to rethink their expectations and assumptions when it comes to mainstream apparel and accessories. One of their starring products is an elevated, eco-twist on the classic Chelsea boot. A timeless staple in every closet, their minimalist boot is waterproof, fashion-forward, and best of all sustainably and ethically made. \r\n\r\nBaxter Wood was founded in 2018 after creators Kweku Larbi and Sarah Smith visited Kweku’s hometown in Ghana and were astounded by the accumulation of plastic waste all around them. Their love of fashion and desire to ameliorate plastic pollution inspired them to create an intricate yet minimalist accessory line with eco-conscious materials, starting with post-consumer plastic water bottles and delving into consciously sourced natural rubber. The name “Baxter Wood'' actually came to Kweku in a dream and he and Sarah later discovered that it was also the name of a nature reserve in Maine. Soon after, Baxter Wood was born and the eco-revolution fueling their fashion brand began! \r\n",

She knew she wanted to create a safe space for others like herself, and thought that skincare was the perfect vessel. Why not provide a product that everyone needs, with a story and community they can join and be part of? \r\n\r\nFrom giving back to environmental causes, using sustainable packaging, and creating an educational blog to promote learning and self care, Allison has created a nourishing and inspiring brand and community - the Activist Skincare. \r\n",
